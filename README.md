### Konnichiwa. I hope you are well. 🙏🏼

Thank you for visiting. Here's a little bit about me:

- 🔭 I have been working as a Full Stack Software Engineer for over 10 years and have successfully developed dozens of small/large scale projects.
- 🌱 I am Learning Constantly. Currently Exploring Machine Learning & Cyber Security. I have some pretty impressive skill badges ask me about them!!! Continus education, mentorship, surfing, and being a husband are my favorite things in life.
- ⚡ In my free time I try to surf, and laugh and be apart of some sort of charitable event.
